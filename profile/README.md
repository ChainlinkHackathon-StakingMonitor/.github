# The Monitor

This repository contains the logic of our Dapp *The Monitor*, our submission to Chainlink's Spring Hackathon 2022.

## What it does

*The Monitor* keeps an eye on your address and checks if you receive any staking rewards. 

Deposit some ETH, set your order, and *The Monitor* will automatically swap a "mirror" amount of the staking rewards you receive for DAI (more tokens coming soon). 

This way, you can sleep easy knowing that a portion of your staking rewards stays tucked away in a stable coin, that you can withdraw from our contract whenever you want! Pretty neat isn't it?

*The Monitor* also keeps an history of the swaps it performs on your behalf, to help with your bookkeeping and, God forbid, tax records.

## The Codebase

This project contains two main repositories:

- [Contract Code](https://github.com/ChainlinkHackathon-StakingMonitor/contract)
- [Front end Code](https://github.com/ChainlinkHackathon-StakingMonitor/front_end)

It also contains a [documentation](https://github.com/ChainlinkHackathon-StakingMonitor/architecture_and_design) repository, which contains the documents we created while designing *The Monitor*.
