# The Monitor

This repository contains the logic of our Dapp *The Monitor*, our submission to Chainlink's Spring Hachathon 2022.

## What it does

*The Monitor* keeps an eye on your address and checks if you receive any staking rewards. 

Deposit some ETH, set your order, and *The Monitor* will automatically swap a "mirror" amount of the staking rewards you receive for DAI (more tokens coming soon). This way, you can sleep easy knowing that a portion of your staking rewards stays tucked away in a stable coin, that you can withdraw from our contract whenever you want! Pretty neat isn't it?*The Monitor* also keeps an history of the swaps it performs on your behalf, to help with your bookkeeping and, God forbid, tax records.
